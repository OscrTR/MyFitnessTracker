## My Fitness Tracker privacy policy

Hello, I'm Oscar Thi√©baut, the developer of My Fitness Tracker. I understand how important your privacy is, especially when it comes to your sport habits. I want to assure you that your privacy is my top priority. This privacy policy explains how I handle your data with My Fitness Tracker.

### 1. No Data Collection

I designed My Fitness Tracker to be a private and personal space for you. The app does not collect, track, or store any of your personal information or data. Your entries and stats are kept on your device, and you have complete control over them.

### 2. No Data Sharing

Because I don't collect any data, there is nothing to share with third parties. Your sport entries and run locations are yours alone, and they remain private at all times.

### 3. Local Storage Only

All data, including your sport entries, is stored locally on your device. My Fitness Tracker does not have access to this data, and it is not stored on any external servers or cloud services. You are the only one who has access to your data.

### 4. No Tracking

My Fitness Tracker does not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising tools. I believe in providing a completely private and distraction-free environment for your sport training.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this privacy policy from time to time. If there are any changes, I will post them in the app and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. I encourage you to check this policy occasionally to stay informed about how I protect your privacy.
